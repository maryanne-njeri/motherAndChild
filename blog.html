    <h4>Brain Body Parenting</h4>
    <p>
      From a leading child psychologist comes this groundbreaking new
      understanding of children’s behavior, offering insight and strategies
      to support both parents and children. These families are
      understandably focused on correcting or improving a child’s lack of
      compliance, emotional outbursts, tantrums, and other “out of control”
      behavior. But, as she has shared with these families, a perspective
      shift is needed. Behavior, no matter how challenging, is not the
      problem but a symptom; a clue about what is happening in a child’s
      unique physiologic makeup.

    <h4>Welcome to Pre-natal care and nutrition</h4>
    <p>
      When you find out you’re pregnant, immediate questions probably come
      to mind: What can I eat? Can I still exercise? Are my sushi days in
      the past? Taking care of yourself has never been more important, but
      it’s not hard to learn. Here’s how to maintain a healthy pregnancy
      through nutrition, vitamins, good habits, and more.</p>
    <h4>Nutrition</h4>
    <p>
      Eating a nutritious diet during pregnancy is linked to good brain development
      and a healthy birth weight, and can reduce the risk of many birth
      defects. A balanced diet will also reduce the risks of anemia, as well
      as other unpleasant pregnancy symptoms such as fatigue and morning
      sickness.</p>

    <h4>What not to eat </h4>

    To protect you and baby from a bacterial or parasitic infection, such as listeriosis, make sure that all milk,
    cheese, and juice are pasteurized. Don’t eat meat from the deli
    counter or hot dogs unless they are thoroughly heated. Also avoid
    refrigerated smoked seafood and undercooked meat and seafood. If you
    or someone in your family has had a history of allergies, speak to
    your doctor about other foods to avoid.

    <h3>When to start postnatal exercise</h3>
    <img src="./assets/blog-img/postnatal.jpg" height="350px"/>
<div class="text">
    <h4>When can I start exercising after birth?</h4>
    <p>If you had a straightforward birth, you can start gentle exercise as soon as you feel up to it. This could
      include walking, gentle stretches, pelvic floor and tummy exercises.
      It's usually a good idea to wait until after your 6-week postnatal check before you start any high-impact
      exercise, such as aerobics or running.
      If you exercised regularly before giving birth and you feel fit and well, you may be able to start earlier. Talk
      to your midwife, health visitor or GP.
      If you had a more complicated delivery or a caesarean, your recovery time will be longer. Talk to your midwife,
      health visitor or GP before starting anything strenuous.</p>

    <h4>What should I be aware of before exercising?</h4>
    <p>
      Your lower back and core abdominal muscles may be weaker than they used to be.
      Your ligaments and joints are also more supple and flexible for a few months after birth, so there's an
      increased risk of injury if you stretch or twist too much.
      Do not rely on your pre-pregnancy sports bra. Your back and cup size are likely to have changed, so get measured
      for a new one.</p>

    <h4>How do I know if I'm overdoing exercise after having a baby?</h4>
<p>
    If your postnatal bleeding (lochia) gets heavier or changes colour (becomes pink or red) after activity, you
    could be overdoing it. You're also likely to feel very tired.
    Listen to your body. Pace yourself and make sure you get plenty of rest too.
